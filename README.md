# Kerbal-Star-Systems-2

Kerbal Star Systems 2 is the successor to Galaxies Unbound and builds greatly upon the work in Galaxies Unbound.  KSS2 takes KSP to yet another new level by bringing you a stunning interpretation of the stellar neighbourhood near Kerbol.

##


## Minimum System Requirements
   * Memory: 8 GB RAM
   * Graphics: 1-2 GB VRAM
   * KSP: 1.11.x - 1.12.5
   
   
## Installation 
### 1. Download KSS2    
  - Delete previous KSS2 versions from GameData before installing. Merging with old files will not ensure the mod to work properly.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/StarCrusher96/Kerbal-Star-Systems-2/releases) 
       - Download KSS2_Core.  Unzip and drop the contents of the zip package onto GameData
       - Download the desired KSS2 system.  Unzip and drop the contents of the zip package onto GameData
  * The `KSS2`-folder should look like this.

### 2. Dependencies
 * [**Kopernicus**](https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases) KSS2 is known to work against Kopernicus release 197
 
### 3. Visuals  
   * [**NEW EVE Volumetrics**]: For the new volumetric clouds, aurorae, geysers, etc. This is the Blackrack EVE and is currently not a free download.  Not required but without it, the experience is greatly reduced
       - If you choose to not purchase the Volumetric EVE, then the two below downloads will give a reduced - though better than nothing experience
       - [**Environmental Visual Enhancements Redux**](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases/): For those that are unable to purchase the new EVE Volumetrics. Many of the more immersive features will not be available.
       - [**Scatterer**](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases): For those that are unable to purchase the new EVE volumetrics.
   * [**Parallax2**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/209714-112x-parallax-pbr-terrain-and-surface-objects-202/): For the interesting ground scatter.  Note: Parallax 1 is not supported
   * [**Singularity**](https://github.com/LGhassen/Singularity/releases): For gravitational lensing around black holes, neutron star, etc ...
   * [**Instantiator**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168992-13x-instantiator/) - ! remove the exampleconfig.cfg. : For neutron star beams.
   * [**NiftyNebulae**](https://github.com/RJVB09/NiftyNebulae/releases): For dust rings, nebulae, etc.
   
### 4. KSS2 General Settings file 
   - Advise that you do not change any default settings unless you know what you are doing
   - GravityFix = True/False : Lowers Black holes', neutron stars' gravity.
   - GroundScatterDistance = x : Choose between 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 12 (groundscatters rendered over x distance in km)
   - RemoveLenseDirt = True/False : Removes lense dirt from all stars.
   - SunAsteroidBelts = True/False : Use this to add asteroidbelts around the Sun.
   - ExtraSolarAsteroids = True/False : Use this to add asteroidbelts around other stars.
   - Scale = x : Rescale * 1 - 2.5 - 10 (!needs [SigmaDimensions](https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-Dimensions/releases))

## After launching the game (!important!)
### Checklist
  * You need Texture quality at its highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds may spawn as black orbs. 

### Maneuver Tool Bug
   * Source: [KSP Community Fixes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/) 
   
The KSP 1.12 maneuver planner tool might cause issues. It can cause stutter and freezes on scene load, when changing SOI or when editing maneuver nodes, especially with Kopernicus modified systems. To solve this, you better disable it.
