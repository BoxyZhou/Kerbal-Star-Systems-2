# Kerbal-Star-Systems-2

Kerbal Star Systems 2 is the successor to Galaxies Unbound and builds greatly upon the work in GU.  KSS2 takes KSP to yet another new level by bringing you a stunning interpretation of the stellar neighbourhood near Kerbol.

## After launching the game (!important!)
### Checklist
  * You need Texture quality at its highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds will spawn as black orbs. 
  * (only for GU 1.3.1 and 1.4.x) To use parallax with GU, you will need to set Terrain Detail to "GU_High" instead of "High" when setting up the parallax settings. A game restart will be needed as well.  If you do not have Parallax, this step is not needed.
  * If you uninstall GU after using parallax, the "GU_High" preset needs to be removed from the KSP general settings.cfg, found in the game files. Scroll to the bottom of the settings.cfg and remove the terrain preset for "GU_High".

### Maneuver Tool Bug
   * Source: [KSP Community Fixes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204002-18-112-kspcommunityfixes-bugfixes-and-qol-tweaks/) 
   
The KSP 1.12 maneuver planner tool might cause issues. It can cause stutter and freezes on scene load, when changing SOI or when editing maneuver nodes, especially with Kopernicus modified systems. To solve this, you better disable it.

## Home Switch and Galaxy mode
  ! Home Switch and Galaxy mode are not currently available available in KSS2. 

## Chart of the Stars

This map shows approximately the correct locations of all the stars that you can find in GU. 
Keep in mind that declination is not visually represented in this 2D map. To achieve this setup for your game, you install each component and you must not use the galaxy mode.
